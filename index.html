                Schematic of an anatomically accurate single pyramidal neuron, the primary excitatory neuron of cerebral
                cortex, with a synaptic connection from an incoming axon onto a dendritic spine.
                Neurons are the primary components of the nervous system, along with the glial cells that give them
                structural and metabolic support.[1] The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system, which
                includes the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which includes the autonomic and
                somatic nervous systems.[2] In vertebrates, the majority of neurons belong to the central nervous
                system, but some reside in peripheral ganglia, and many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs
                such as the retina and cochlea.

                Axons may bundle into fascicles that make up the nerves in the peripheral nervous system (like strands
                of wire make up cables). Bundles of axons in the central nervous system are called tracts.

                Anatomy and histology
                Phasic or bursting. Neurons that fire in bursts are called phasic.
